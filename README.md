# World Time App

My very first Flutter application! I went through this by following the instructions from [The Net Ninja](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg )'s course on [Flutter Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jLYyp2Aoh6hcWuxFDX6PBJ).

## The application

This application will simply tell the time after fetching it from the [World Time API](http://worldtimeapi.org/) and will display it alongside an indication of whether it is daytime in the selected area.
## What I learnt
There was a lot to learn in this series ranging from:

 - Dart programming
 - API calls in Flutter
 - State management
 - Core mobile platform development fundamentals

The lessons run much deeper than what is stated above, but I can now create basic and simple applications.
